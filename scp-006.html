                Special Containment Procedures
              </h5>
              <p>
                Whereas the nature of SCP-006 does not warrant any extensive
                containment, a certain level of secrecy is necessary regarding
                the object's existence and properties, for obvious reasons. The
                following procedures are required not for personnel safety, but
                to deny or hide knowledge of SCP-006's effects from the
                personnel who interact with it.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  All personnel interacting with SCP-006 in any physical way are
                  required to wear modified Class VI BNC suits. Before personnel
                  are allowed to perform procedures, they must be briefed with
                  Material SCP-006B or SCP-006C. SCP-006A Briefing is the
                  correct one and is restricted to only those with O5 clearance.
                  To ensure personnel are wearing suits properly, they are to be
                  submerged into a pool of water. Any air bubbles spotted
                  signify a leak in the suit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Procedures with SCP-006 are to be carried out under extreme
                  surveillance. In case of contact with SCP-006, the commander
                  in charge will announce Procedure 006-Xi-12, which the
                  personnel have been briefed to believe to mean high toxicity
                  is present and they must evacuate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any procedure in which liquid is acquired from SCP-006 must be
                  approved by three (3) O5 level personnel. The liquid is to be
                  transferred in a Quad-Sealant Container and under armed guard.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If at any time personnel come into contact with SCP-006 or
                  liquid from SCP-006, they are to be confined and terminated
                  after sufficient studies are done. Due to the nature of
                  SCP-006, the most effective termination method is
                  incineration. (For full report, see file SCP006-TerO5)

                        SCP-006 is a very small spring located 60 km west of
                        Astrakhan. Foundation Command was aware of its existence
                        since the 19th century, but were unable to secure it
                        until 1991 due to political reasons. On the spot of the
                        spring, a chemical factory has been constructed as a
                        disguise, with the majority of laborers under Foundation
                        and/or Russian control. The liquid emitted from the
                        spring has been chemically identified as simple mineral
                        water in 1902, but has the unusual property of "health".
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Ingesting the liquid produces the following properties
                        in human beings: the ability to regenerate DNA damaged
                        by sufficient duplication, heightened excitement of
                        cellular duplication, vastly improved abilities in the
                        repair of damaged tissue, and a frightening increase in
                        the effectiveness of the human immune system. Upon
                        testing the liquid on animal subjects, hostile bacteria
                        and viral agents were destroyed immediately. Many
                        reptiles and birds were unaffected, while higher
                        primates experienced the same benefits as humans.
