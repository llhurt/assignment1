                      Special Containment Procedures
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                      SCP-002 is to remain connected to a suitable power supply
                      at all times, to keep it in what appears to be a
                      recharging mode. In case of electrical outage, the
                      emergency barrier between the object and the facility is
                      to be closed and the immediate area evacuated. Once
                      facility power is re-established, alternating bursts of
                      X-ray and ultraviolet light must strobe the area until
                      SCP-002 is re-affixed to the power supply and returned to
                      recharging mode. Containment area is to be kept at
                      negative air pressure at all times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Teams including a minimum of two (2) members are required
                      within 20 meters of SCP-002 or its containment area.
                      Personnel should maintain physical contact with one
                      another at all times to confirm there is another person
                      present, as perception may be dulled, skewed, or
                      influenced by proximity to the object.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      No personnel below Level 3 are permitted within SCP-002.
                      This requirement may be waived via written authorization
                      from two (2) off-site Level 4 administrators. Command
                      staff issued such a waiver must be escorted by at least
                      five (5) Level 3 Security personnel for the duration of
                      their contact and must temporarily surrender their rank
                      and security clearance. Following contact, command staff
                      will be escorted at least 5 km from SCP-002 to undergo a
                      seventy-two (72)-hour quarantine and psychological
                      evaluation. If deemed fit for return to duty by psych
                      staff, rank and security clearance may be restored when
                      quarantine expires.

                        SCP-002 resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a
                        volume of roughly 60 m³ (or 2000 ft³). An iron valve
                        hatch on one side leads to its interior, which appears
                        to be a standard low-rent apartment of modest size. One
                        wall of the room possesses a single window, though no
                        such opening is visible from the exterior. The room
                        contains furniture which, upon close examination,
                        appears to be sculpted bone, woven hair, and various
                        other biological substances produced by the human body.
                        All matter tested thus far show independent or
                        fragmented DNA sequences for each object in the room.

                        To date, subject has been responsible for the
                        disappearances of seven personnel. It has also in its
                        time at the facility further furnished itself with two
                        lamps, a throw rug, a television, a radio, a beanbag
                        chair, three books in an unknown language, four
                        children's toys, and a small potted plant. Tests with a
                        variety of lab animals including higher primates have
                        failed to provoke a response in SCP-002. Cadavers as
                        well fail to produce any effect. Whatever process the
                        subject uses to convert organic matter into furnishings
                        is apparently only facilitated by the introduction of
                        living humans.

                          village) to ensure no outside knowledge of the object
