                    <p>
                      When handling items SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13, proper
                      procedure is vital. The items are not permitted to be
                      moved off-site unless accompanied by two Level 4 security
                      personnel. Under no circumstances should any other
                      component of SCP-004 be taken through SCP-004-1. The
                      effects of doing so are as yet unknown, and the current
                      cost of experimentation makes further research
                      impractical. Should any of the objects contained within
                      SCP-004-1 breach containment, or the facility be breached,
                      the keys must be brought inside and the door closed prior
                      to activation of Site 62’s on-site warhead. Unauthorized
                      removal of keys from the testing area is grounds for
                      immediate termination.

                    <p>
                      Level 1 clearance is required for basic access to

                        SCP-004 seems to propagate spatiotemporal anomalies.
                        Personnel leaving the facility report losing time. Those
                        who have been in the site for weeks insist that they had
                        only been in the facility for several days, and records
                        of work completed and supplies consumed support their
                        claims. Other temporal anomalies involve SCP-004-2
                        through -13, especially the reappearance of
                        SCP-004-CAS01 and SCP-004-CAS02 exactly ██ years after
                        using SCP-004-██. ████████████████████ has been assigned
                        to investigate all aspects of these time anomalies.
                        Spatial anomalies include the impossibly large
                        dimensions of the area opened by SCP-004-7. Similarly,
                        the 2003 blackout incident suggests that there exists an
                        alternate plane of existence within the same space that
                        Site-62 occupies.

                        the local authorities to begin testing. Tests show that
                        SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13 all fit into a single lock
                        on the large barred door. 12 Class D personnel are
                        assigned to test the effects of the door. Of the twelve
                        test subjects each trying a different key to enter the
                        room, only two survive. Opening the door with any key
                        except SCP-004-7 or SCP-004-12 caused the test subjects
                        to be torn apart in multiple directions; however, no
                        dismembered parts were found until later. At the time of

                        recovered (with the exception of the subject using

                        Testing on SCP-004 reveals that ten of the keys open
                        SCP-004-1 on a dimension where the laws of physics and

                        home dimension. Test subjects meeting these hostile
                        conditions are torn apart, their body parts deposited in
                        various locations, only three of which have been
                        verified to be on Earth. Material deposited at two of
                        these points appears immediately; material deposited at
                        the third appears exactly ██ years into the future. The

                        Current testing focuses on two avenues of research. The

                        topologies. The second [DATA EXPUNGED] suggest that

                        speech, following long-term psychotherapy. He was able
                        to tell the psychiatrist that he saw a massive green
                        creature, so large that much of its body extended beyond
                        his field of view. He reported innate fear and sudden
                        recognition, “as if it were something buried deep in
                        [his] primal fears,” and forced implantation of
                        “incomprehensible” memories. Subject displays acute

                        unvarnished wooden box. The box may be unlocked by the
                        "safe" key, SCP-004-7, as well as five of the "unsafe"
                        keys (see Document SCP-004-1).

                        Upon unlocking SCP-004-14 with SCP-004-7, the box opens
                        automatically on hinges. The volume of the space inside
                        is precisely five times greater than the outer
                        dimensions imply. Items placed within while the lid
                        remains open do not affect the weight or any other
                        properties of the box. When the lid is closed and
                        locked, however, all items inside vanish irretrievably.
                        Personnel locked inside the box are also irretrievable,
                        although losing personnel in this fashion appears to
                        affect significantly the dreams experienced by [DATA
